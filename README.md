# Project 3

In this repo you can find all the code developed for the Project 3 of the Computational Physics course (AP3082 of the Applied Physics Master programme at TU Delft). This project's topic was free of choice. The project is about verifying the quantum adiabatic theorem solving the Schrödinger equation for several quamtum systems using *Crank–Nicolson method*. The adiabatic theorem claims that if a quantum system is in a quantum state that is an eigenstate of the system, even if the system evolves in time, the initialized eigenstate prevails provided that the evolution of the system is slow enough (with respect to the temporal natural order of magnitude of the system). That condition of "slow" evolution can also be referred as "adiabatic". You can find the slides used for the presentation of the project in Slides_Final_Form.pptx.

## Instructions

For the final project of Computational Physics we encourage you to define your
own project!

The only requirement we ask for is that it should be a simulation of a
physics-related project (but we consider physics-related rather broad, and e.g.
simulation of biological systems or an engineering problem are also absolutely
ok).
We do advise you though to start from a project where there is some existing literature.
in this way you have a starting point as well as something to compare your simulation to
for validation.

We encourage you to discuss your project idea with us during the time of class, 
or remotely via the planning issue #1. 

In any case, you need to fill in a short plan (a few lines) together with a
reference to literature in the planning issue, *and* have it agreed by us before
May 27 (i.e. latest two weeks before the presentation).

If you have problems to come up with a good project, we can provide you with
proven project ideas. But we first want you to try coming up with your own project!
Having designed your own project will also give a small bonus for the grade.
